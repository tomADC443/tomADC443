## 🚀 Stuff I do...

### 🌊 Ocean Eco Watch - Co-founder
*** Tags: Full-Stack, Machine Learning, Earth Observation, Remote Sensing ***
We are dedicated to leveraging satellite imagery to detect floating marine debris in coastal areas.


> [By 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish measured by weight.](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf)

Our mission is to support clean-up operations, research, and development by identifying and mapping marine debris, providing critical insights to combat this pressing challenge and foster a more sustainable relationship with our oceans.

### 🛰️ Pixel-based Classification and Outlier detection - Solo Project

*** Tags: Machine Learning, Earth Observation ***

An approach to find Plastic in the Ocean.
This notebook applies a one-class SVM for outlier detection and a fully connected neural network (MLP) for pixel-wise classification of marine debris using the MARIDA dataset (Sentinel-2). It evaluates both models separately and combined, aiming to filter irrelevant pixels and classify debris without relying on spatial information.

### 🌱 Sustainable Freshwater Management - Platform - Solo Project
*** Tags: Machine Learning, Remote Sensing. Google Earth Engine, SvelteKit, LeafMap, FastAPI, GeoPandas***

The project is a full-stack web application for analyzing freshwater bodies affected by Water Hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes), an invasive species causing ecological and economic damage worldwide. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine, the backend performs temporal and spatial analyses, including NDVI calculation, hotspot detection, surface area measurement, and growth rate tracking. The frontend provides an interactive dashboard and map to visualize the results.

The platform is live but not yet ready for mass use. If you wanna have a look at it, just write me an email and I give you access :smile:
